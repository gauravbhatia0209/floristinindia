ALTER TABLE orders ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS customer_message TEXT;
ALTER TABLE orders ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS receiver_name VARCHAR(255);
ALTER TABLE orders ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS receiver_phone VARCHAR(20);
ALTER TABLE orders ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS alternate_phone VARCHAR(20);
ALTER TABLE orders ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS uploaded_files JSONB DEFAULT '[]';
ALTER TABLE orders ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS delivery_instructions TEXT;
ALTER TABLE orders ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS order_source VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'website';

-- Update existing orders to extract receiver info from shipping_address
UPDATE orders
SET
  receiver_name = shipping_address->>'name',
  receiver_phone = shipping_address->>'phone',
  alternate_phone = shipping_address->>'alternate_phone'
WHERE receiver_name IS NULL;

-- Add indexes for better performance
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_orders_receiver_name ON orders(receiver_name);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_orders_delivery_date ON orders(delivery_date);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_orders_customer_message ON orders USING gin(to_tsvector('english', customer_message));
```
