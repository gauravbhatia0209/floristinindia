# Payment Gateway Checkout Administration Guide

## Overview

As an admin, you now have granular control over which payment methods customers see during checkout, separate from the technical gateway configuration.

## Two-Level Payment Control

### 1. System Level (Enabled/Disabled)

- **Purpose:** Controls whether the payment gateway is technically functional
- **When Enabled:** Gateway can process payments if configured properly
- **When Disabled:** Gateway cannot process any payments

### 2. Checkout Level (Show/Hide at Checkout)

- **Purpose:** Controls customer visibility during checkout
- **When Shown:** Customers see this as a payment option
- **When Hidden:** Payment method is not available for customer selection

## Use Cases

### ‚úÖ Common Scenarios

**Temporary Maintenance:**

- Keep gateway enabled but hide from checkout during maintenance
- Quickly restore without reconfiguring credentials

**Soft Launch:**

- Enable and configure new payment method
- Hide from checkout until ready for customers
- Test internally before public availability

**Order Amount Restrictions:**

- Show premium payment methods only for high-value orders
- Hide expensive processing methods for small orders

**Seasonal Control:**

- Hide international payment methods during domestic-only promotions
- Show specific methods during festival sales

If you're setting this up fresh, run this SQL after the main payment schema:

```sql
-- Already included in database-payment-checkout-update.sql
-- Run this file in your Supabase SQL editor after the main schema
```

## Customer Experience

**What Customers See:**

- Only payment methods marked "Available at Checkout"
- Custom display names and descriptions
